# --- Terraform Folders ---
# Local .terraform directory contains downloaded providers and modules.
# These are large and can be re-downloaded with 'terraform init'.

# These contain the current state of your infrastructure and often include
# sensitive data (passwords, keys) in plain text. Use a remote backend instead.

# Note: You may want to include a 'variables.tf' (declarations),
# but ignore 'terraform.tfvars' (actual values).
